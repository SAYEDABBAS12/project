            So we are talking about habits hmmm <br>  <span>  there are two types of habbits good and bad</span>
           <br> Good Habits- <br> I am not proud of it very much but i wanna say i just have good habit of book reading and i love Stories based on future and Magic and i don't take too much pressure in exams and my exams are from 27/9/21 and i am doing this project on 24/9/21 i think i will submit this by tomorrow and you know it's all about managing and another habit i want to mention that i loved cycling but nowaday you know i can't go out but there's a hope they are saying it will be opened from october if you are from the future tell me are the school's open i am just kidding so you know i can't tell you everything because i myself don,t know everything so meet you in the bad habits but let me check what's bad in me i think i have to discuss with mom oh! i got it but you will know it in next part byyy!!! note from the scriptwriter: cut 50 rupees for the overactingüòÇüòÇüòÇüëçand in the end you will get a twist wait for it!!and peaceout and if you don't know meaning of peaceout search on google so that's why we call him google baba. <br> Bad Habits- <br> So you will know while reading the page i really talk to much and you know when i was younger i did'nt talk at and at the ptm all teachers say that he is very good but he did'nt talk at all , <br> Number 2: Sometimes i make timetables and i follow it only one day and i forgot it.<br>Number 3: I can't do a thing for a long period of time.so that's it.  
            <span>There is a twist that there is no twistüòÇ</span>
